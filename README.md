Introduction:
Sign language is a crucial mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Developing technology to interpret and understand sign language gestures can greatly enhance accessibility and communication for this community. This project focuses on the creation of a real-time sign language detection system using pose estimation from a webcam. By leveraging keypoint information obtained through MediaPipe's holistic pose estimation model and deep learning techniques, the system aims to accurately recognize and interpret sign language gestures.
 
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and accurate sign language detection system that can interpret gestures captured through a webcam in real-time. The system employs pose estimation to extract keypoint information, and a deep learning model is trained to classify these keypoints into different sign language gestures. The objective is to enable seamless communication for individuals who use sign language as their primary mode of expression.
 
Design Process:
1. Pose Estimation Setup:
The project begins by setting up the MediaPipe holistic pose estimation model, which provides information about facial landmarks, body pose, and hand landmarks. The `mediapipe_detection` function processes webcam frames to obtain pose estimation results, and the `draw_landmarks` function visualizes these landmarks on the video feed.
2. Data Collection:
The code includes sections for collecting training data through the webcam. Users can record sequences of frames for different sign language gestures, with corresponding keypoints saved in NumPy arrays. This step is crucial for training the deep learning model to recognize diverse sign language gestures.
3. Data Processing:
The `extract_keypoints` function is defined to extract relevant keypoints from the pose estimation results for each frame. These keypoints include facial landmarks, hand landmarks, and full-body pose. The collected data is organized into sequences, representing videos, and labels are assigned based on the sign language gestures performed.
4. Model Training:
The deep learning model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of GRU layers for sequence processing and densely connected layers for classification. The model is trained on the collected data, with sequences of keypoints as input and sign language labels as output. The training process involves optimizing for accuracy using categorical cross-entropy loss.
5. Real-time Sign Language Detection:
Once the model is trained, it is loaded to perform real-time sign language detection. The webcam feed is continuously processed, and the model predicts the sign language gesture based on the extracted keypoints. Visualization tools are employed to enhance user experience by displaying the recognized gesture and its corresponding probability.
 
Conclusion:
The developed sign language detection system demonstrates the successful integration of pose estimation and deep learning to interpret sign language gestures in real-time. By leveraging the capabilities of MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras, the system achieves accurate and efficient detection. The optional data collection process allows for customization and expansion of the gesture recognition capabilities.
 
Future Enhancements:
- Most socially impactful idea for future consideration is to produce an improved model built on a larger, idealized dataset.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for better accessibility.

In conclusion, this project serves as a foundational step towards creating inclusive technologies that bridge communication gaps for individuals using sign language. The combination of pose estimation and deep learning offers a powerful solution for real-time sign language interpretation.
